## **🧾Search Methods**

### **1. 🔎 Global Search**
![Global Search](../src/guide/global.png)
By default, IEEE Xplore searches only the **metadata**. You can limit the search to specific fields using **Boolean expressions**.

**Example:**

```
"Abstract":ofdm AND "Publication Title":communications
```

The platform automatically normalizes British/American spelling, singular/plural forms, and verb tenses, and offers type-ahead keyword suggestions.

**Searchable Fields:**

  * `"Abstract"`
  * `"Publication Title"` (journal or conference title)
  * `"Document Title"` (article title)
  * `"Author"`
  * `"Affiliation"` (author’s institution)
  * `"Standard Number"`
  * `"ISBN"/"ISSN"/"DOI"`

-----

### **2. ⚙️ Advanced Search**
![Advanced Search](../src/guide/advanced.png)
  * **Access:** Click **“Advanced Search”** beneath the main search box.

  ::: tip **How to use**
    * **Fill in the three-line template**: choose ==**“field – operator – search term”**==; add more rows as needed.
    * Supports **“AND / OR / NOT”**; ==parentheses `()` for nesting are **“not”** supported.==
    * Use the options at the bottom of the page to limit publication years.
  :::

-----

### **3. ⌨️ Command Search**
![Command Search](../src/guide/command.png)
  * **Access point:** **“Command Search”**, located to the right of Advanced Search.
  ::: tip **How to use**
  *  The syntax is identical to the single-box search, but it provides field buttons and respects parenthesis priority, making it ideal for complex strategies.
  :::

**Example:**

```
("Abstract":GAN OR "Keyword":adversarial) AND ("Publication Title":medicine OR "Publication Title":biology)
```

This mode supports `NEAR`/`ONEAR` operators, nested parentheses, and has a query length limit of 40 words.

-----

### **4. 🧑‍🔬 Author Search**
![Author Search](../src/guide/author.png)
This feature lets you quickly locate papers by a specific author.

  * **Access:** Choose **“Authors”** from the drop-down menu on the left side of the top search box.
  
  ::: warning **Points to remember**
    * The platform searches all fields and is ==**not case-sensitive**==.
    * **Wildcards** are allowed, but at least three letters must be given in either the first or last name (e.g., `M*ke Jone` is valid; `J*y` is not).
    * Citation downloads display the normalized form: ==surname plus first-name initials==.
    * The selected author name appears at the top of the results; a small **“x”** beside it lets you remove that filter.
    * Use the left-hand facet panel to refine the results further.
  :::

-----

### **5. 📚 Publication Retrieval**

* You can select the **type** of publication you need to find and quickly locate it by searching by keywords.
*	You can search by the **first letter** of the publication or click By Topic to filter a second time by discipline.If you select a discipline type, you can still filter again by the first letter of the publication.
*	You can also refine your search results using the **cluster analysis bar** (Refine results by) on the left side of the page. Sort By and Items Per Page adjust the number of titles displayed per page and the sorting order.
*	You can find the publication you need and directly click on the title to access its journal page (journals and magazines) or abstract (standards, e-books, and online courses).Some journals offer the option to download entire issues.

### **2. Sorting the results**

Seven sort options are available:
![Sort Options](../src/guide/options.png)
1.  `Relevance` (default)
2.  `Newest First`
3.  `Oldest First`
4.  `Most Cited by Papers`
5.  `Most Cited by Patents`
6.  `Most Popular` (by download/view volume)
7.  `Publication Title A–Z / Z–A`

-----

### **2. Refining the results**
![Refine Results](../src/guide/refine.png)

Use the **left-hand facet panel** for:

  * `Search within results` (secondary search)
  * `Content Type` (journal, conference, standard, etc.)
  * `Publication Year` (drag the year slider)
  * `Author` (only names in the current result set)
  * `Affiliation` (only institutions in the current result set)
  * `Topic / Publisher / IEEE Technical Society`

::: note
==Multiple selections can be combined, and counts refresh instantly.==
::: 
-----

### **2. Secondary search**
![Secondary Search](../src/guide/secondary.png)

Type a new term in the **“Search within results”** box at the top of the page, or select facets on the left. The query is automatically combined with the previous one using **AND**.

  * For example, after searching for `Java`, entering `XML` in the secondary box is equivalent to searching for `Java AND XML`.
